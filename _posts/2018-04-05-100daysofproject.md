The [100 Day Project](https://www.the100dayproject.org/) begins today and I’ve spent all day thinking of fun projects I could start; I thought about creating patterns from buildings, drawing flowers for 100 days and even creating patterns from Victorian Illustrations. All of these would have been fun but sadly not useful, hence why I’m blogging here.

It’s over 2 years since I wrote on this blog and I still don’t have a website. I’m not going to kid myself and say creating myself a website will be a fun project, it’s easily the most difficult piece of work of my career but I’ve reached the point where I really need a website.

A lot has happened in the last 2 years; I became busy with work and as much as creating a website is a necessity, it’s hard to turn down paid work to do my own website. I’ve sadly suffered from bad health [Being Productive with a Chronic Illness](https://thehumaninthemachine.com/katherine-cory/2017-november-20) and my time has become really precious so it’s been more important when working to make sure I’m concentrating on paid work because no matter how bad my health is, I still have bills to pay. My health has meant I’ve had to stop networking and going to conferences and meet-ups, which has meant my social circle has become smaller. I’ve also relocated to Manchester, which unfortunately has made my social circle even smaller. Relocating as a freelancer is hard and at times it’s felt like I’m starting my business from scratch again. I don’t have a network or reputation here but due to poor health it’s hard to rectify it like I did the first time around.

I’ve learnt how to adapt the way I work since my relapse and I network more online in Facebook groups so it’s more important than ever that I have a website and let my work speak for itself. I’ve known this for months but I still haven’t made any steps forward, to be honest I’d much rather be selling my [bees](http://we-stand-together.co.uk) or working on my [greeting cards](https://folksy.com/shops/katherinecorydesign) but I feel it’s time.

I think 100 days is adequate to build something; I know not every day I’ll have something shiny and exciting to show but as long as every day I do a little piece of work, by the end of 100 days I ought to have something online. Over the next few days, I expect to get this blog up and running (I’m going to attempt to get Docker up and running on my MacBook) and look over where I left this project back in 2015. I’m also going to come up with a schedule to work out a timeline and take it from there.

**Wish me luck, I think I may need it!**
