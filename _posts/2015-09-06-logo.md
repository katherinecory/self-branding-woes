I have two confessions to make... I started the rebrand of my business with a new logo nearly two years ago and I actually hired another designer* to do it for me...

## Why

I've been keen to redo my logo because the old one is a million miles away from my personality; they feel like polar opposites. I'd like to think I was quite personable, even bubbly and on a good day I'd even go as far as saying I quite like people *(joking)* but my logo is so frosty, hard and masculine. Along with the angular, graphic shapes and cold colours, it just doesn't feel like me, let alone represent me as a person or business! There's no connection between my current brand and my personality; instead a struggle between what I like as a designer and who I am.

To address this I decided I wanted to rebrand with a logo that was friendly and curvy, something that was almost inviting and the exact opposite of what I had. I wanted something that was custom and unique to me. I'm a huge fan of letterers and typographers and the work they do. I wish I could say otherwise but I attempted a custom typeface. There was a little part of me that wondered if I was the next Jessica Hische even though it was something I'd never attempted before and I never spent any time sketching. Needless to say it was a disaster...

## The How

I made the brave decision to hire someone. It's crazy, there's no way I'd ever offer to do work for a client that I knew I couldn't do. I know when to hire someone but again pride got in the way and I initially forgot that process when it came to my own work.

I sat down with a close friend who has a lot of experience when it comes to lettering and creating custom logos. I found the briefing experience one of the biggest design challenges I had ever faced; I was nervous about trusting he'd know what I wanted to achieve, when maybe I wasn't entirely sure myself and whether he could deliver this. I found it difficult not being in control and it was a test to let go. It was an odd situation because he is one of my closest friends and I have worked with him for four years. I know him and I know his work, yet being his client terrified me.

I obviously know how to receive a brief and how to create a mood board, he still had to give me a little tough love and tell me to back off when I causally mentioned I could help him choose sans serif typefaces. Not only am I a bad client for myself, it turns out I'm a bad client for other designers!

## The Results

After seeing the initial sketches, immediately all my fears disintegrated, I knew we were on the right track. However, I felt a new wave of nerves when giving feedback. I found it difficult to articulate what I was thinking even though I'm used to receiving critiques and I understand what feedback I find helpful. I expect my clients to give me clear feedback that gives me direction after a little coaxing but I was worried I'd give the wrong feedback or even offend my friend.

*Initial sketches*

The sketches were combined to create this initial design; I loved the basic shape but felt the typography was "*off.*" Sadly, as much as I hated to admit it, adding *design* to the logo didn't work and wasn't an option. I wrestled a long time about whether *design* was necessary, as I'd included it previously but in the end I felt the logo was stronger without.

The second round of amends included a tweak to the *Cory* and different type options but as soon as I saw the Verlag Black version I knew I had my logo.

## The Affect

This process certainly gave me a better understanding of what clients go through when they hire me. I started to consider how clients feel, especially when they don't have any experience of hiring a web designer and when I'm one of hundreds or even thousands to choose from.

It was unusual to see the process from the other side but it's definitely made me more compassionate when dealing with clients. Not only do I have a new logo that I still love after eighteen months, I gained a fresh perspective from this experience!
